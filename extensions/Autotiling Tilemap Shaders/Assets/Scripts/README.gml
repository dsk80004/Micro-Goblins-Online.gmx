/*
    Important! The global game settings have to be changed for this asset to work correctly! See below. (You can ignore this if the global game settings were imported automatically.)
    
    The tiles have to be organized on the same texture page for the shaders to be able to draw them, so go to texture groups in the global game settings
    and click "Add" to create a new texture group. Call it for example "Tiles". Click your newly created texture group in the list on the same window and change
    the settings so that "No cropping" is checked, "Texture group NOT scaled" is unchecked, and "Texture border width" is set to 0.
    Then go through all your tile sprites and change "Texture group" on the bottom right to your newly created texture group.
    
    That should hopefully be it, otherwise you can contact me at "http://goo.gl/BjEPkD" or sending an email to "asbjorn.lystrup@gmail.com".
    
    Thank you so much for purchasing the asset!
