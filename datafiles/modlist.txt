=====Weapon Mods=====


===Global===
Accelerate (Increase attack speed for each consecutive shot. Resets one second after the attack)
+++Repeater (Full Auto attacks)
+++Charge (you must charge up the weapon first)
Dynamic Charge
++Dash
++Evade
AOE (this gives AOE, multiples cause larger AOE size) (radius = 16+(16*modcount))
continuous (modcount = dmge tick increased, this will make an AOE continuous, or cause tick based damage, mutliples cause longer time for aoe)
+knockback
+++Enlarge (double the size of the weapon and projectiles)
+++shrink (half size)
Force Push (wouldnt this be the same thing as knockback?)
Force Pull (basically grapple) (happens before melee weapon spawns, happens at collision for ranged)
tractor beam ^^^
Chain Lightning (hits each enemy in a certain distance, 1*modcount = arcs)
Teleport (teleports the colided to a random open position)
Frosty (slows the target)
Blind (when mixed with aoe and continuous, this becomes the fog of war)



===Melee===
+++Swift (swings Faster)
+++Slow (swings slower)
+++Ranged (unlocks ranged mods for the melee weapon, assigns a random projectile sprite perminately)
+++Back Stab (swings behind you; also?)

+++Chained (Similar to yoyo's and Flail maces, good for rope darts and what not)
+++Thrust (Chun Li kick annimation for weapons) (multiple will act as a combo attack from a single button press)
+++slash
whip

+++Flail (changes the attacking method into a flail attack, adds attack range but makes it a bit slower.) (multiples will give it a further reach)

Keen (slightly increases damage, greatly inreases decapitation chance)
double strike (attacks a second time)
Reflect (reflects bullets back at their owner)
AimBot (always attacks in the direction of the closest enemy) (this is a melee modifier for balancing purposes) (Stack [90, 180, 360] degree assistance)
Aerial Strike (every time you hit it spawn a copies of itself, which slams into the ground)
??AutoSwing (This is NOT rapid fire! As long as it's actively equipped it will automatically swing at enemies, if reflect is also on the weapon it wil swing at projectiles too)
??punching glove (doesnt matter what weapon you're using, it launches a punching glove out aswell)
??move faster when you're swinging it?
