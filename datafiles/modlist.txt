=====Weapon Mods=====


===Global===
+++Repeater (Full Auto attacks)
+++Charge (you must charge up the weapon first, massive damage increase)
++Dash
++Evade
+++Enlarge (double the size of the weapon and projectiles)
+++shrink (half size)
+++AimBot
Latent (delays the weapon spawn)
Accelerate (Increase attack speed for each consecutive shot. Resets one second after the attack)
Dynamic Charge
AOE (this gives AOE, multiples cause larger AOE size) (radius = 16+(16*modcount))
+continuous (modcount = dmge tick increased, this will make an AOE continuous, or cause tick based damage, mutliples cause longer time for aoe)
+knockback


vampirism (chance to gain life after a kill)
Force Push (at weapon spawn (just after it spawns) force push shit away)
Force Pull (happens before melee weapon spawns)
grapple (force pull at collision)    /    lode stone (continuous force pull on hit enemy)
knockback (force push at collision)

Stasis (esentially freeze / stun effect; mod count = stasis time)

Chain Lightning (hits each enemy in a certain distance, 1*modcount = arcs)
Teleport (teleports the colided to a random open position)
Frosty (slows the target)
Blind (when mixed with aoe and continuous, this becomes the fog of war)

==general damage and death effects==
	Keen (general damage increase, and decapitation increased chance {basicaly just a filler mod for any weapon you have with the mods you already want})
	Gibbing (general damage increase, and greatly increase gibbing chance by removing the chance for decap {basicaly just a filler mod for any weapon you have with the mods you already want})
	Incinoration (need shader but make a magma texture slowly consume the players model, then replace with ask which drops to a pile, look around for insperations)


===Melee===
+++Swift (swings Faster)
+++Slow (swings slower)
+++Ranged (unlocks ranged mods for the melee weapon, assigns a random projectile sprite perminately)
+++Back Stab (swings behind you; also?)

+++moveable (unlocks the ability to move while swinging, although it also allows you to guide which direction you are attacking, the change in direction is effected by mod count)

+++Chained (Similar to yoyo's and Flail maces, good for rope darts and what not)
+++Thrust (Chun Li kick annimation for weapons) (multiple will act as a combo attack from a single button press)
+++slash
+++Flail (changes the attacking method into a flail attack, adds attack range but makes it a bit slower.) (multiples will give it a further reach)
+++Extend (at the end of the attack animation, extend the reach of the weapon infront of the player by 2tiles*mod_count)
whip (Will need to be able to make use of paths, and stretched sprites to path, will need at least 60 paths for the animation... uhhhg)


"deception"? (damages you when using it although greatly increased damge, slight increase to size, and adds a color effect to the sprite?)
Keen (slightly increases damage, greatly inreases decapitation chance)
Jaws (1 modcount = 2 melee weapons lerch out from the side clamping down infront of the player, mod5 = 10)
Reflect (reflects bullets back at their owner)
Aerial Strike (every time you hit it spawn a copies of itself, which slams into the ground)
??AutoSwing (This is NOT rapid fire! As long as it's actively equipped it will automatically swing at enemies, if reflect is also on the weapon it wil swing at projectiles too)
??punching glove (doesnt matter what weapon you're using, it launches a punching glove out aswell)

===Ranged===
Divine Spray "spray and pray" (inaccuracy + similar to rewpeater although used for use with card shuffler, flame thrower, cone of fire)
Ray beam (turns the entire projectile into a ray, not really sure what this intails although the words, freeze ray made me think of this one.)
+++Sticky (projectiles exclusive continuous mod)
Piercing (attacks through multiple enemies)
+++Ricochet (projectiles will bounce 1 time if coliding at a 45 degree angle or less, if piercing is present they will bounce at any angle but only 5 times)
ethernal (attacks through walls)
+++boomerang (returning projectiles, 1 floor collision prevention)
+++nega-rang? (return TO the projectile) //get a better name for this. its a bit like a hook shot, but probably instant? maybe add the vectors?
+++inaccurate (random projectile angles)
Scoped/Snipe (Extra range)
Quick shot (projectiles move at double speed)
Drag (projectiles move at half speed)
+++seeking (heat seeking projectiles)
+++guided
+++Burst (3 shots in a row, with a 2-3 frame delay between them, input direction can be chnged but not movement?)
+++Laser/Beam (10 shots in a row, every frame) Drops the damage and cooldown time by a ton.
+++Cluster (it's like buck shot but happens after the projectile was sent out)
+++Multishot (3 projectile)
+++Bonus Shot (1 projectile in a random angle)
+++Mirror Shot (Shoots a projectile behind you)
+++Targeting
+++Air Strike
"Ray Casting", or "ray tracing", or just "tracer" (this has a very very small heat seeking adjustment, although it will skip the step events, and jump dirrectly to collision events, In practice this means that the projectiles will appear to spawn directly on their targets, usefull for a BFG or a cone of electricity type weapon [example: electro gun GTA2])
Welder (similar to repeater although it keeps the weapon spawned, creating new projectiles, although will over heat depending on how many mods it has, although this also means more projectiles come out faster aswell)

Arc Lightning (lightning arcs between your projectiles and your self, similar to laser but more dynamic, 3*modcount lightning arcs)
air born (projectile floats in place for a bit before acvtually launching forward)
scatter shot (similar to multishot although you get 3 times as many, size decrease, with a ton of inaccuracy, and 1/3 the range)

Synergies

Guiding + Airstrike should make the weapon laser guided? same code as targeting?
