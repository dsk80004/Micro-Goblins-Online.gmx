+++Ranged (unlocks ranged mods for the melee weapon, assigns a random projectile sprite perminately)
Back Stab (swings behind you; also?)
Thrust (Chun Li kick annimation for weapons) (multiple will act as a combo attack from a single button press)

??Chained (Similar to yoyo's and Flail maces, good for rope darts and what not)
